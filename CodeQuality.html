    <h1>Code Quality</h1>
    <p>The code here is mainly produced on a weekend morning before the rest of my house wake up. My time is limited.</p>
    <p>The projects here are whims and fancies of mine. They might be finished, they might not. They might work, they might not.</p>
    <p>As such, they are hobbies and do not represent me or my work in a professional capacity. Use at your own risk.</p>
